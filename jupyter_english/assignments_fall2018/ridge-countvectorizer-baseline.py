# With this, you'll get 1.91185 on [public leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-good-is-your-medium-article/leaderboard). This is much higher than our validation MAE. This indicates that the target distribution in test set somewhat differs from that of the training set (recent Medium articles are more popular). This shouldn't confuse us as long as we see a correlation between local improvements and improvements on the leaderboard.

# Some ideas for improvement:
# - Engineer good features, this is the key to success. Some simple features will be based on publication time, authors, content length and so on
# - You may not ignore HTML and extract some features from there
# - You'd better experiment with your validation scheme. You should see a correlation between your local improvements and LB score
# - Try TF-IDF, ngrams, Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings
# - Try various NLP techniques like stemming and lemmatization
# - Tune hyperparameters. In our example, we've left only 50k features and used `C`=1 as a regularization parameter, this can be changed
# - SGD and Vowpal Wabbit will learn much faster
# - In our course, we don't cover neural nets. But it's not obliged to use GRUs or LSTMs in this competition.
